        Protection Laws. I-AMVOCAL will ensure that all I-AMVOCAL employees, subcontractors and other personnel will
        comply
        with obligations that are equivalent to the obligations imposed on I-AMVOCAL under this section to the extent
        that
        such I-AMVOCAL employees, subcontractors and personnel carry out any processing of Licensee Personal Data under
        or
        in connection with this Agreement. I-AMVOCAL will not intentionally perform any act that puts Licensee in breach
        of
        its obligations under applicable Data Protection Laws, and I-AMVOCAL will notify Licensee if in I-AMVOCAL's
        opinion
        performance of a Licensee instruction would result in breach of applicable Data Protection Laws. Nothing in this
        Agreement will be deemed to prevent either party from taking the steps it reasonably deems necessary to comply

    <p class="text-left regular f-16">
        <span class="bold">14. General</span> The Parties acknowledge that: (i) Licensee alone will determine the

        performance of this Agreement; (ii) Licensee will be the Data Controller in respect of all Licensee Personal
        Data; (iii) I-AMVOCAL will be the Data Processor in respect of Licensee Personal Data; and (iv) I-AMVOCAL will
        only
        process Licensee Personal Data for the limited purpose of performing its obligations under, and during the term
        of, this Agreement.
    </p>

    <p class="text-left regular f-16">
        <span class="bold">15. Requests</span> In a manner that conforms to any timescales set out in applicable Data
        Protection Laws, (and, in any event, as soon as reasonably practicable, if sooner, or as specified below in this
        section), I-AMVOCAL will comply with any written request by Licensee to: (i) correct or delete inaccurate
        Licensee
        Personal Data; (ii) provide a copy of Licensee Personal Data relating to an EU Data Subject in the possession or
        control of I-AMVOCAL; (iii) provide information about the Processing of Licensee Personal Data including
        information (or a report in sufficient detail if requested by Licensee, within thirty (30) days of such request)
        about the technical and organizational security measures that it uses to comply with the Processor Security
        Obligations or information about how its processing of Licensee Personal Data complies with applicable Data
        Protection Laws; (iv) within ten (10) days of such request or notice (as applicable) from Licensee, assist and
        provide the required information in respect of any request or notice, or any anticipated request or notice, by
        or on behalf of any EU Data Subject or by a Supervisory Authority in respect of Licensee Personal Data; (v)
        delete or return to Licensee the Licensee Personal Data after the end of the provision of the services related
        to the processing, unless otherwise required by applicable law; and (vi) otherwise provide reasonable assistance
        to Licensee as necessary to allow Licensee to comply with applicable Data Protection Laws.
    </p>

    <p class="text-left regular f-16">
        <span class="bold">16. Use</span> I-AMVOCAL will not, without Licensee’s prior written consent: (i) use Licensee
        Personal Data for I-AMVOCAL own purposes; or (ii) carry out the processing by automatic means of any Licensee
        Personal Data for the purpose of evaluating matters about an EU Data Subject that constitutes the sole basis for
        any decision that significantly affects such Data Subject.
    </p>

    <p class="text-left regular f-16">
        <span class="bold">17. Transfer</span> I-AMVOCAL may disclose Licensee Personal Data throughout the world to
        fulfill the purposes described above. This may include transferring Licensee Personal Data to other countries
        (including countries located outside the European Economic Area) that have different data protection regimes and
        which are not deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for EU Personal Information. To ensure that your
        Licensee Personal Data is sufficiently protected when transferred outside the EEA I-AMVOCAL has self-certified
        its
        compliance with the US Privacy Shield with the U.S. Department of Commerce. I-AMVOCAL will engage subcontractors
        only pursuant to Licensee’s general or specific authorization. Licensee specifically authorizes the engagement
        of I-AMVOCAL's parent, subsidiaries, and other companies under common control with I-AMVOCAL as subcontractors.
        Licensee generally authorizes the I-AMVOCAL's engagement of any other third parties as subcontractors. When
        engaging any subcontractor, I-AMVOCAL will enter into a written contract with such subcontractor containing data
        protection obligations not less protective than those in this DPA, to the extent applicable to the nature of the
        services provided by such subcontractor. Where I-AMVOCAL engages a subcontractor pursuant to Licensee’s general
        authorization, I-AMVOCAL will, at least 30 days before the new subcontractor processes any Licensee Personal
        Data,
        notify Licensee of the engagement. Licensee may object to such subcontractor by providing written notice to
        I-AMVOCAL within ten (10) business days of being informed of the engagement. In the event Licensee objects to a
        new
        subcontractor, Licensee and I-AMVOCAL will work together in good faith to find a mutually acceptable resolution
        to
        address such objection. If the parties are unable to reach a mutually acceptable resolution within a reasonable
        timeframe, Licensee may, as its sole and exclusive remedy, terminate the agreement impacted by the subcontractor
        by providing written notice to I-AMVOCAL.
    </p>

    <p class="text-left regular f-16">
        <span class="bold">18. Complaints</span> I-AMVOCAL will promptly notify Licensee if any complaints are received
        by
        I-AMVOCAL from third parties about the processing of Licensee Personal Data, and I-AMVOCAL will not make any
        admissions, settle or take any action which may be prejudicial to the defense or settlement of any such
        complaint and will provide to Licensee such reasonable assistance, at Licensee’s cost, as it may require in
        connection with such complaint. If I-AMVOCAL acquires, on behalf of and independently from Licensee, any EU
        Personal Data from EU Data Subjects as part of the Services, I-AMVOCAL will give such individuals a data
        protection
        notice describing the intended use of such EU Personal Data, in a form provided or approved by Licensee. Without
        prejudice to its other obligations under this Agreement, if I-AMVOCAL becomes aware of any unauthorized,
        unlawful
        or dishonest conduct or activities or any breach of this section (including the occurrence of any Data Breach),
        I-AMVOCAL will promptly notify Licensee and provide all relevant information reasonably required by Licensee
        about
        such conduct, activities and/or breaches.
    </p>

    <p class="text-left regular f-16">
        <span class="bold">19. {{ env('APP_NAME')}} Security Obligations</span> I-AMVOCAL acknowledges that it is
        obliged
        to comply with the Processor Security Obligations (including management of on-going compliance and effective
        security management) in respect of Licensee Personal Data and, in particular, that it will comply with the
        following obligations: (i) take appropriate technical and organizational security measures to safeguard against
        any unauthorized and unlawful processing of Licensee Personal Data and against any accidental loss or
        destruction of, or damage to, EU Personal Data; (ii) only process Licensee Personal Data in accordance with
        written instructions given by Licensee; (iii) take reasonable steps to ensure the reliability of those I-AMVOCAL
        employees, agents or other personnel that have access to Licensee Personal Data; and (iv) ensure that all
        I-AMVOCAL
        employees, agents or other personnel involved in processing Licensee Personal Data have undergone reasonably
        adequate training in the care and handling of EU Personal Data.
    </p>

    <p class="text-left regular f-16">
        <span class="bold">20. Audit</span> If a relevant data protection Supervisory Authority is required by law or
        regulation to audit the data processing facilities from which I-AMVOCAL processes Personal Data in order to
        ascertain and/or monitor compliance with Data Protection Requirements, then I-AMVOCAL will cooperate with the
        audit
        at Licensee’s expense.
